BitTickerTalker
=========

Raspberry PI ticker talker (yeah, I know. not very creative. so sue me.)

This app is a modification of BitTalker with a few config tweaks and added support for the SainSmart 1.8" TFT Color LCD (see https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki#install for setting up the TFT display)
